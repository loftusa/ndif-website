The National Deep Inference Fabric (NDIF) is awarding Summer Engineering Fellowships to participate in an high-priority summer project to develop and rapidly scale AI research infrastructure to keep pace with the precipitous increase in scale of state-of-the art AI.
</p>
<p>
NDIF is an NSF-funded project to create an innovative, highly-transparent large-scale AI inference infrastructure to enable scientific research on the largest open AI models. Read more about the <a href="https://ndif.us/about.html">NDIF project and team here</a>, and read about the <a href="https://nnsight.net">NNsight API architecture here</a>. This <a href="https://twitter.com/davidbau/status/1787597395741835564">twitter thread also provides some more context</a>.
</p>
<p>
NDIF has recently received NSF support, including sufficient GPU resources to create a scalable service. This summer the project is embarking on a rapid summer initiative to implement:
</p>
<ul>
<li>High-throughput parallelism for a uniquely transparent large-scale LLM inference service.</li>
<li>Service autodeployment for public scientific use on NCSA HPC GPU clusters.</li>
<li>Robustness and monitoring for reliable serving for research users.</li>
</ul>
<p>
Before Fall 2024, open LLM models are anticipated that will be five to ten times larger than the current state-of-the art. Accordingly, scientific infrastructure to support research at that scale will be urgently needed. The NDIF Summer Engineering Fellowship is an intensive program for systems- and ML-focused students to contribute to an active state-of-the-art AI research engineering project in the public interest.
</p>
<p>
Your work during the fellowship will be essential for scaling up the innovative NDIF inference infrastructure to prepare the groundwork to enable interpretability, safety auditing, and transparent research at a scale that matches the pace of the ongoing increase in AI model complexity. You will closely collaborate and work under the supervision of a team of leading machine learning and software engineering systems professors.
</p>
<p>
The program will be held in-person in Boston during Summer 2024.
